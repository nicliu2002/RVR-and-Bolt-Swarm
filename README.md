# RVR-and-Bolt-Swarm

## Heterogeneous Swarming Formation of BOLT and RVR Robots

### Brief Description

The aim of this project is to create multiple different swarming formations utilising communications between Sphero BOLT and RVR robots using the spherov2 python SDK as well as the Sphero Public SDK. 

### Implementation

Look it all really boils down to using the Sphero Public SDK on board a Raspberry Pi for the RVR and the spherov2 Python unofficial SDK on the BOLT to make the two communicate over IR.

### To - Do List

Create RVR comms test code and run this shit in the lab - with this, try to figure out just how much information and try to figure out how to get location happening on this.
